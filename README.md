# Welcome ðŸ‘‹
Frontend Mentor (FEM) is a website that provides frontend coding challenges for
developers of all levels. The challenges range in difficulty from beginner
to advanced and cover a variety of topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and responsive design.

I regularly attempt the challenges on FEM as a way to practice and
improve my skills. Although I haven't solved every challenge yet,
I use each one as an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.

The solutions I've completed so far are my own and showcase my
coding style and approach to problem-solving.
As I continue to work on new challenges,
I look forward to honing my skills even further.
